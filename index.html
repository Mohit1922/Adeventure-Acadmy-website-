                <h2>Back in 2012, I was doing research for a presentation and stumbled upon a big problem.</h2>
                <p>India had tons of people with degrees, but companies couldn't find enough qualified workers! 
Graduates were stuck without jobs, <br> while big companies didn't hire them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-text2">
                <h2>This surprised me, especially considering how many people live in India.</h2>
                <p>After digging deeper, I discovered a huge gap in skills: only 3 out of 100 people were considered 
"ready" for good jobs. Many ended <br> up stuck in low-paying roles like customer service, while 
countries like the UK and USA zoomed ahead</p>

                <h2>I had experience both in business (startups) and teaching (tutoring), and I wanted to <br>
use both to help young people succeed.</h2>
                <p>So, after 7 years in the corporate world, I took a leap - I quit my job and started a learning center
called Adventure Academy</p>

them to try new things, learn from their mistakes, and discover what they're good at.</p>
